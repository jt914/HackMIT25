### Codecademy Clone

I want to build a codecademy clone with the following features: 
1. Dashboard with lessons. There should be a sidebar and also lessons with boxes. An image of what I'm thinking of is attached below. 
2. Basic settings
3. A landing page
4. A login/signup page. The login and signup features should be implemented with JWT tokens. The database that we are using should be MongoDB. Here's the necessary inforamtion: 
- Cluster: cluster0
- Project: hackmit
- Username for cluster: garygao333_db_user
- Password for cluster: rnft9uEP2nU2zLNA
- Current IP address: 192.54.222.142
- Installtion method is driver: npm install mongodb
- Also this for the driver: mongodb+srv://garygao333_db_user:rnft9uEP2nU2zLNA@cluster0.ns4xyla.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=Cluster0
5. Add a few dummy lessons that the user can register for. The lessons should be hardcoded for now (the user can kind of click through the lessons when leraning it with certian activities). The database should store what lessons the user is enrolled in.
